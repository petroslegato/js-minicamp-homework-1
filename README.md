# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables
	A variable is an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value; or in simpler terms, a variable is a container for a particular set of data (like integer, float, String etc.)

	* Strings
	A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally considered as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. 

	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. Functions can be "called" from the inside of other functions.

	* `if` statements
	The if statement is a decision-making statement that guides a program to make decisions based on specified criteria. The if statement executes one set of code if a specified condition is met (TRUE) or another set of code if evaluated to FALSE.

	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
	A data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century. The Boolean data type is primarily associated with conditional statements, which allow different actions by changing control flow depending on whether a programmer-specified Boolean condition evaluates to true or false.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
